	<h1>How to Play:</h1>
	<!--
	You should see a nice grid, looking something like this:<br>
	<img src="nicegrid.gif" style="width:250px;height:200px;"><br>
	-->

	Click on the buttons in the grid. You should hear one of us speaking a name, of someone else in the group.<br>
	<br>
	<b><mark>Today's game: "Pairings".  This game is different from yesterday's.</mark></b><br>
	<br>
	Somewhere in the grid, there are two different "inverse pairs". An inverse pair is where, for instance, one tile has Joe saying Susan, and another tile has Susan saying Joe.<br>
	To win the game, find the two pairs, and send me a message that identifies where the four tiles are, before anybody else solves it.<br>
	<br>
	This one is much harder than game #1. Only women's voices were selected for this go-round, and some of the lady's voices
	in our family are <i>really</i> similar! If you don't know our family's voices, you'd find this game near impossible.
	But if you don't know our voices and still want to give it a try, <a href="AWW-PAIRS-primer.html">this primer</a> and some general 
	game play techniques might get you there!<br>
