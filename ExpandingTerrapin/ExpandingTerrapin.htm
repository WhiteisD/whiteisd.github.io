<h2>LADY WITH A FAN</h2>

Let my 
<expand>
  inspiration flow<br>
  in token lines suggesting rhythm<br>
  that will not forsake me<br>
  till my tale is told and done<br>
</expand>
<br>

While the
<expand>
   firelight's aglow<br>
  strange shadows in the flames will grow<br>
  till things we've never seen<br>
  will seem familiar<br>
</expand>
<br>

Shadows of
<expand>
   a sailor forming<br>
  winds both foul and fair all swarm<br>
  down in Carlisle he loved a lady<br>
  many years ago<br>
</expand>
<br>

Here beside
<expand>
 him stands a man<br>
a soldier by the looks of him<br>
who came through many fights<br>
but lost at love<br>
</expand>
<br>

While the
<expand>
 storyteller speaks<br>
a door within the fire creaks<br>
suddenly flies open<br>
and a girl is standing there<br>
</expand>
<br>

Eyes alight
<expand>
 with glowing hair<br>
all that fancy paints as fair<br>
she takes her fan and throws it<br>
in the lion's den<br>
</expand>
<br>

"Which of
<expand>
 you to gain me, tell<br>
will risk uncertain pains of Hell?<br>
I will not forgive you<br>
if you will not take the chance"<br>
</expand>
<br>

The sailor gave
<expand>
 at least a try<br>
the soldier being much too wise<br>
strategy was his strength<br>
and not disaster<br>
</expand>
<br>

The sailor coming
<expand>
 out again<br>
the lady fairly lept at him<br>
that's how it stands today<br>
you decide if he was wise<br>
</expand>
<br>

The storyteller
<expand>
 makes no choice<br>
soon you will not hear his voice<br>
his job is to shed light<br>
and not to master<br>
</expand>
<br>

Since the end
<expand>
 is never told<br>
we pay the teller off in gold<br>
in hopes he will come back<br>
but he cannot be bought or sold<br>
</expand>
<br>

<h2>TERRAPIN STATION</h2>

Inspiration,
<expand>
 move me brightly<br>
light the song with sense and color,<br>
hold away despair<br>
</expand>
<br>

More than
<expand>
 this I will not ask<br>
faced with mysteries dark and vast<br>
statements just seem vain at last<br>
some rise, some fall, some climb<br>
to get to Terrapin<br>
</expand>
<br>

Counting stars
<expand>
 by candlelight<br>
all are dim but one is bright:<br>
the spiral light of Venus<br>
rising first and shining best,<br>
</expand>
<br>

From the northwest
<expand>
 corner<br>
of a brand-new crescent moon<br>
crickets and cicadas sing<br>
a rare and different tune<br>
Terrapin Station<br>
</expand>
<br>

in the shadow
<expand>
 of the moon<br>
Terrapin Station<br>
</expand>
<br>

and I know
<expand>
 we'll be there soon<br>
</expand>
<br>

Terrapin - I
<expand>
 can't figure out<br>
</expand>
<br>

Terrapin - if 
<expand>
 it's an end or the beginning<br>
</expand>
<br>

Terrapin - but
<expand>
 the train's got its brakes on<br>
</expand>
<br>

and the
<expand>
 whistle is screaming: TERRAPIN<br>
</expand>


<h2>AT A SIDING</h2>

While you
<expand>
 were gone<br>
these spaces filled with darkness<br>
The obvious was hidden<br>
</expand>
<br>

With nothing
<expand>
 to believe in<br>
the compass always points to Terrapin<br>
</expand>
<br>

The sullen 
<expand>
wings of fortune beat like rain<br>
You're back in Terrapin for good or ill again<br>
For good or ill again<br>
</expand>
<br>
